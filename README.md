# Segmenting E-Commerce Users through Behavioral Clustering: Insights for Optimized Marketing Strategy

Abstract:
Understanding user behavior is crucial for optimizing marketing strategies in e-commerce environments. This study applies unsupervised machine learning,specifically K-Means clustering,to identify distinct behavioral segments within user session data from a large online retail platform. Key session features such as event count, price interactions, category diversity, and funnel engagement were engineered and analyzed to reveal six meaningful customer clusters. These included Loyal Buyers, Cart Flooders, Deal Hunters, Premium Browsers, Bargain Browsers, and Window Shoppers. Visual tools like PCA plots and radar charts helped validate segment separation and interpret user traits. The study found that only half of the segments exhibited significant purchase behavior, while others reflected minimal conversion potential. This segmentation allows marketers to design targeted retention strategies for high-value groups and suppress spending on non-converting cohorts. The paper contributes to the growing body of research that uses retrospective clustering for behavioral insight and marketing alignment, offering a practical roadmap for post-session user engagement and strategic budget allocation.
