# Uncovering-E-Commerce-Consumer-Behavior-ML-approach-Using-Multi-Class-Classification-and-Clustering
Abstract:
This study investigates customer behavior on an e-commerce platform using two machine learning pipelines: multi-class classification to forecast product preference and clusters to categorize customer segments. We sampled the dataset of 1 million events from the Kaggle "E-Commerce Behavior Data from Multi-Category Store". We performed in depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineered behavioral features, and trained classification models such as Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes. During the same time frame, we clustered using K-Means models to identify shopper profiles. The classification models showed substantial class imbalances, however, the Naive Bayes model showed slight promise for minority class identifying. The clustering models identified four shopper groups, characterized by mean price sensitivity, diversification for products of interest, and activity level. This dual method would provide insight about targeting effective marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement with e-commerce.
